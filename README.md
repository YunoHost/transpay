# Trans Pay [![Donate with Trans Pay](https://dons.xn--transposes-i7a.eu/static/donate-with-transpay.png)](https://dons.transposées.eu/)

Trans Pay is developed by [Collectif Trans Posé·e·s](https://transposées.eu) for our own use and that of other associations.

This tool is used to receive and manage donations:

* Supports one-time and monthly donations
* Process cards with Stripe
* Flexible and customizable

It works for individuals and it works for organizations. Expect to
spend about an hour or two setting up everything and then you're good to go.
